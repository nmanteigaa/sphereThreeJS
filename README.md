# sphereThreeJS
I followed a tutorial from YouTube to introduce myself into Javascript again and to learn ThreeJS.
This tutorial is about making a website to move an sphere.


Commands I used:
npm create vite@latest      //to create the folder with all the files already set up (I changed the main, index and style files)
npm run dev                 // to run the server to test the results of the code
